    Simplify common tasks for building and testing Java projects using Gradle.
    Based on the official CircleCI gradle orb version 2.2.0 and tested with
    gradle wrapper 6.6+, this orb takes advantange of the git history when
    restoring caches, improving build time when build files are modified.
    Note: This orb uses internal Gradle classes to delete unused dependencies. This might
    break the build, if so revert to the official orb (and post an issue at
    https://github.com/entur/gradle-orb).
